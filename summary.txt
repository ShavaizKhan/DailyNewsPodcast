Scientists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature say we can welcome three more species of the world's tallest mammal. Researchers looked at natural features across Africa such as deserts, rivers and valleys that could have separated animals in the past. As a single species, the giraffe was classed as vulnerable to extinction, although some sub-species were increasing in numbers.
